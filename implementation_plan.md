# Implementation Plan

### Objective

I am building a website for my new client, Permits & More. 

My client's business helps architects, developers, sign contractors, general contractors, as well as home owners secure and approve permits to do construction and rennovations in the city of San Diego, California and the surrounding areas.

They also provide Building Code violation assistance, and help you remove violations to keep your building in code compliance so you can optimize the value of your property.

The goal of this website is to showcase my client Permits & More as a reputable, professional, and effective company that a prospective client should work with, and to provide clear CTAs for a prospective client to connect with Permits & More about contracting their services.

### Design

Redesign this landing page to look like it was built by a top-tier design agency charging $50k+. Focus on:

- Refined typography hierarchy with elegant font pairings
- Subtle, sophisticated animations (micro-interactions, smooth transitions)
- A cohesive, premium color palette (avoid anything that feels "template-y")
- Polished details: shadows, gradients, borders that feel intentional and high end
- Visual rhythm and alignment that feels considered

The only constraints I'll give you as that you have to use this blue color in the design #3B82F6 and you need to use the logo in the navbar that I've attached. Lastly, if you use any stock photography please make sure it's of San Diego because they are a San Diego based company that primarily does all their permitting work in San Diego.

### Copywriting

Take full liberty of the copywriting for this website. In the client's own words this is how they describe themselves and their services. This information needs to conveyed in a way that is marketed and comes across well to the user on the website.
